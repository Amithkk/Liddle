#Liddle

Project is still in planning stages.. 

I want to create the 'developers' online editor.. heavy compatibility with common key commands.

My main focus currently is obtaining a list of commands and specifying in detail what they should do in each case. 

If you would like to contribute, feel free to drop me a suggestion in an **Issue** or just fork / merge the 'Notes.md' file. 

Thanks!
